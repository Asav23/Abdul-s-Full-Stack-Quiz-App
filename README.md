A full-stack quiz application currently running in production. Users can play multiple-choice questions (MCQs), complete full quizzes, study with flashcards, and create and manage entire quiz collections.

The backend is built with Java Spring Boot and JPA repositories, connected to a SQL database for persistent storage. The application is Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.

This project demonstrates skills in backend development, database design, containerization, and creating a smooth, user-friendly interface for interactive learning.
